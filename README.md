# City EV Charging Intelligent Infrastructure

Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the infrastructure for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations through intelligent data-driven solutions. By analyzing existing data on charging stations and utilizing predictive modeling, this project seeks to optimize the distribution and functionality of EV charging stations. The main objectives include forecasting the demand for charging points, determining optimal locations for new stations, and predicting future energy requirements.

Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The initial phase of the project involves performing a thorough exploratory analysis of the available data. This step helps in understanding the patterns, inconsistencies, and the overall structure of the data, which is crucial for the subsequent predictive modeling.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is carried out to prepare the raw data for analysis. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering to enhance the models' accuracy and efficiency.

Charging Point Prediction
We employ clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN and BIRCH to analyze spatial distribution and usage patterns. The goal is to predict where additional charging points might be needed in the future based on current usage and growth patterns.

Station Placement Forecasting
Predictive models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests are used to identify potential new locations for charging stations. These models help forecast where new stations should be placed to meet future demand efficiently.

Energy Demand Forecasting
Using a range of regression techniques and time series forecasting (including ARIMA), this project predicts future energy demands for existing and new charging stations. This helps in managing the load and planning the energy supply accordingly.

Data

The project utilizes detailed datasets containing information about current charging stations, including their capacity, geographic location, usage patterns, and associated energy consumption.
(Note: Describe how one can access these datasets, or outline their structure if they are not publicly available.)
